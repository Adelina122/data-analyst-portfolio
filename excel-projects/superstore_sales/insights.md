### Dashboard Insights – Global Superstore Analysis

This document summarizes the key insights from the Excel dashboard created using the [Global Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/global-superstore-dataset/data). 
The analysis focuses on sales trends, profitability, markets, customer segments, and product performance.

### Monthly Sales & Profit Trend

Sales show clear ups and downs over time, with several strong peaks, especially toward later months. 
Profit generally follows the sales trend, but not always at the same level, which suggests that higher sales don’t always mean higher profit. 
This could be influenced by discounts or higher costs in peak periods.

### Market Performance: Sales vs Profit

APAC is the strongest market, generating the highest sales and profit by a clear margin. 
The US and EU also perform well, with similar sales levels but slightly lower profit. 
Smaller markets like Africa, EMEA, and Canada contribute much less overall, showing limited impact on total performance.

### Total Profit by Customer Segment

The Consumer segment generates the highest total profit, making it the most valuable customer group.
Corporate customers come second, while the Home Office segment contributes the least profit. 
This suggests that targeting consumers may offer the highest return, while Home Office customers might require a different pricing or cost strategy.

### Top 10 Sub-Categories by Profit

Sub-categories such as Copiers, Appliances, Phones, and Bookcases are the main profit drivers.
These products consistently generate high profit and appear to be strong candidates for further investment, promotion, or expansion.

### Bottom 5 Sub-Categories by Profit

Sub-categories like Envelopes, Furnishings, Labels, and Supplies show very low or near-zero profit.
Despite generating sales, these items contribute little value and may even reduce overall profitability. 
This indicates potential issues with pricing, discounts, or supply costs.

### Overall Insights

- APAC, US, and EU are the most important markets for profitability.
- The Consumer segment is the most profitable customer group.
- A small number of sub-categories drive most of the profit, while others underperform.
