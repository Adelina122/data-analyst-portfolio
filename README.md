A collection of beginner-friendly data analysis projects using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, focused on data cleaning, reporting, and turning data into clear insights for decision-making.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my data analysis learning projects, created as part of my transition into a Junior Data Analyst / BI / Reporting role.
The projects focus on working with real-world style data, building reports, and turning data into clear, practical insights for decision-making.

My background is in computer science and project assistance, so I’m especially interested in the intersection of data, reporting, and business processes.
